# GeneticAirTrafficNetwork

The files are mostly for exploratory analysis and therefore are written in notebook style.
The project is aimed to analyze the air traffic network properties in a large Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we aim to find the optimal graph in the event of a targeted outage by genetically breeding a network as described by Gen et al. (Network Models and Optimization: Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm Approach)
